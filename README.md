### Features
* Open source (MIT license)
* Pure Python; no binaries or external dependencies save for the Python interpreter (and whatever libraries it uses internally)
* Static HTML publishing
* Dynamic page and site previews
* Plugin system
* Multiple sites and blogs supported in a single installation
* Multiple users and granular permissions (contribute, write, edit, publish, manage, etc.)
* Key/value store for metadata on objects
* Drag-and-drop media management included but optional

### Planned additions
* Multiple edit format support (e.g., Markdown)
* Multiple template type support (e.g., Jinja)
* Publishing from external files rather than in-DB data
* Command-line functionality
* L10N
* ~~Python 2.x backwards compatibility~~ (Sorry, we're going to be 3.2+ from now on.)

... more to come ...

This project is still very raw; it won't work yet if you try to deploy it. It's being
committed publicly to show that progress is taking place on it. We are, however,
getting close to providing an alpha-test version that can be manually installed.
